Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. Its orbital period around the Sun of 87.97 days is the 
shortest of all the planets in the Solar System. It is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the messenger of the gods.

Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and never exceeds 28Â° away from the Sun. 
When viewed from Earth, this proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western or eastern horizon 
during the early evening or early morning. At this time it may appear as a bright star-like object, but is often far more 
difficult to observe than Venus. The planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar to Venus and 
the Moon, as it moves in its inner orbit relative to Earth, which reoccurs over the so-called synodic period 
approximately every 116 days.
